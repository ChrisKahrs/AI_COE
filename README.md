Internal AI Service Provider/COE
When implementing AI within a company, a common pattern is to have one group take the lead. This is often central IT, but not always; a key business unit can work just as well. There are many aspects to rolling this structure forward, and this blog will discuss many of them to ensure you have a plan, or at least a way to think about each of them.

Responsibilities for a COE (Center of Excellence)
Vetting Application Portfolio:

Responsible for assessing applications from individual business units for corporate fit. This process often involves quantifying business value and technical capability, plotting them along the x and y axis to prioritize applications. Items in the top right quadrant are approved first. Sometimes, the COE may simply provide feedback, leaving the final decision to each business unit.

Guidance on AI Application Development:

Providing advice to other business units on how to craft applications using generative/classical AI. Many application development teams excel in web development but lack expertise in generative AI. The COE can offer tips and guidance, especially for current search and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) patterns prevalent in AI/LLM applications.

Strong LMMOps Model and Process:

Ensuring a robust model for managing machine learning operations (MLOps), specifically for large language models (LLMs). This includes monitoring, maintaining, and updating models to ensure they meet the company's standards and needs. Moving models to production is key.

Model Management:

Managing models across business units can become complex. A centralized COE can streamline testing new models and maintaining an internal model catalog, aiding in adoption and future-proofing.

Testing of New Models:

The COE should handle the evaluation and testing of new AI models to ensure they meet the company's performance and ethical standards before deployment.

Key Management:

Overseeing the management of cryptographic keys used in AI systems to ensure security and compliance with company policies.

API Management:

Managing APIs to ensure they are secure, efficient, and meet the needs of various business units. This includes version control and monitoring API usage.

Support for LLM/Ticketing:

Providing support and a ticketing system for issues related to large language models, ensuring quick resolution and continuous improvement.
Key links: Azure Support Plans, Azure Service Health
Legal Indemnification Requirements:

Managing legal risks associated with AI usage, ensuring compliance with regulations, and protecting the company from potential liabilities.
Key links: Microsoft AI Legal, Microsoft AI Compliance
Corporate Compliance:

Ensuring AI projects comply with corporate rules and regulations, including data privacy laws and industry-specific standards.
Key links: Azure Compliance Offerings, Microsoft Compliance Manager
Cost Containment and Resource Utilization:

Planning and managing the costs associated with AI projects, optimizing resource utilization and capacity planning to prevent overspending.
Key links: Azure Cost Management, Azure Capacity Planning
Efficient Use of LLMs:

Large language models can be expensive if not used appropriately. The COE should ensure efficient and effective use to maximize ROI.
Key links: Azure Machine Learning Cost Management, Azure AI Optimization
Chargebacks to Business Units:

Implementing a chargeback system where business units are billed based on their usage level and the specific services they utilize.

Security Implementation:

Ensuring top-notch security, potentially using services like Entra, to protect AI systems and data.
Key links: Azure Active Directory (Entra), Azure Security Center
Independent Software Vendors (ISVs):

Approving third-party software or SaaS systems and tools for use within the company, ensuring they meet security and performance standards.
Key Links: Azure Marketplace, Microsoft Partner Network
Approved System Integration (SI) Partners:

Vetted SI partners with expertise in your business and AI can be crucial for developing and deploying generative AI applications into production.

LLM/GenAI Business Value
1. Enhanced Decision Making: - AI-driven insights provide a deeper understanding of business operations and market trends, enabling better and faster decision-making processes.

2. Increased Efficiency: - Automating routine tasks with AI frees up human resources for more strategic work, improving overall productivity and reducing operational costs.

3. Personalized Customer Experiences: - Leveraging AI to analyze customer data can lead to highly personalized interactions, increasing customer satisfaction and loyalty.

4. Innovation and Competitive Advantage: - Implementing cutting-edge AI solutions can foster innovation, providing a significant competitive edge in the marketplace.

5. Cost Reduction: - AI can optimize resource allocation and reduce waste, leading to substantial cost savings across various business functions.

6. Risk Management: - AI can enhance risk management by predicting potential issues and enabling proactive measures to mitigate them.

7. Scalability: - AI systems can handle large-scale operations efficiently, allowing businesses to scale their operations without a proportional increase in costs.

Conclusion
This can be a daunting checklist. Once you determine which items are key for your corporate AI Service Provider function, we are happy to have specific discussions around each or review your architecture as a whole. If you do not wish to centralize these functions, the first business unit to roll out generative AI solutions can offer a "blueprint" documenting their approach. This can help new business units avoid common pitfalls and ensure a smoother implementation process. Starting from scratch is challenging, and many teams forget one or more of these crucial elements.

Thank you!
