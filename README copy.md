<h1>Internal AI Service Provider/COE</h1>

<p>When implementing AI within a company, a common pattern is to have one group take the lead. This is often central IT, but not always; a key business unit can work just as well. There are many aspects to rolling this structure forward, and this blog will discuss many of them to ensure you have a plan, or at least a way to think about each of them.</p>

<h2>Responsibilities for a COE (Center of Excellence)</h2>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Vetting Application Portfolio:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Responsible for assessing applications from individual business units for corporate fit. This process often involves quantifying business value and technical capability, plotting them along the x and y axis to prioritize applications. Items in the top right quadrant are approved first. Sometimes, the COE may simply provide feedback, leaving the final decision to each business unit. [see tech section as well](pointer to that section)</li>

</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Guidance on AI Application Development:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Providing advice to other business units on how to craft applications using generative/classical AI. Many application development teams excel in web development but lack expertise in generative AI. The COE can offer tips and guidance, especially for current search and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) patterns prevalent in AI/GenAI applications.</li>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>This can be a daunting checklist. Once you determine which items are key for your corporate AI Service Provider function, we are happy to have specific discussions around each or review your architecture as a whole. If you do not wish to centralize these functions, the first business unit to roll out generative AI solutions can offer a "blueprint" documenting their approach. This can help new business units avoid common pitfalls and ensure a smoother implementation process. Starting from scratch is challenging, and many teams forget one or more of these crucial elements.</p>

<p>Thank you!</p>
